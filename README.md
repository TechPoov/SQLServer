# 🖥 Overview
Gdrive-To-Gsheet is an advanced Google Apps Script utility designed to scan any Google Drive folder and generate a structured, formatted, and analysis-ready Google Sheet output.

It supports files, folders, metadata, deep folder trees, multiple profiles, resume-based execution, and custom column preservation — all in a user-friendly, reliable workflow.

Perfect for teams and individuals performing audits, compliance checks, inventory management, migrations, or simply trying to understand the structure of a complex Drive hierarchy.

# Features
## 1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Multi-Profile Scan Engine
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; > &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Set up multiple scan jobs in the Profiles sheet. Each profile runs independently with its own Name, Folder ID, Mode, and Depth limits.

## 2. Three Powerful Scan Modes
Files — scans only files
Folders — scans only folders with folder-level metrics
Both — full content + folder structure, ideal for audits

## 3. Time-Sliced Smart Worker
Large folder trees often time out in Google Apps Script.
This tool avoids that by using a resume-safe, slice-based worker system:

Handles tens of thousands of items
Never exceeds script limits
Automatically continues in the background
Robust against interruptions

## 4. Automatic Resume

If a scan is interrupted (quota hit, script time, browser close):
State is saved
Tool picks up exactly where it stopped
No duplicates, no resets, no lost time

## 5. Custom Column Preservation
If you add custom columns (Owner, ReviewedBy, Status, etc.):
They are not deleted
The tool merges them back into new scan results
Perfect for manual tagging, governance, or cleanup workflows

## 6. Clean, Professional Output Format

Each output sheet includes:
Hyperlinked file or folder names
Fixed-width columns for Path and File/Name
Auto-resized metadata columns
Hidden technical columns (ID)
Optional raw URL column (if enabled)

## 7. Profile-Level Navigation

Upon completion:
The ProfileName becomes a hyperlink
Clicking it jumps directly to the output sheet
Older output is archived as <ProfileName>_Old

## 8. Lightweight & Admin-Friendly
No external libraries.
No add-ons.
Runs inside your Google Sheet.
No installation for end users.
